## Introduction
This repository contains artifacts used in the demo of Alex and Tao's Azure Governance session at Experts Live USA, Austin, Texas, March 2019.

## Demos
### Azure Blueprint

**Hub environment**
The sample blueprint used in this demo was developed by Tao. You can find it [HERE](../master/Blueprint/managementSubConfig).

**Spoke environment**
This sample blueprint was developed by Alex and will deploy a net VNet in the spoke subscription and configure the VNet peering across 2 subscriptions by using Azure Managed Identities. You can find it [HERE](../master/Blueprint/Blueprint-VNET-peering)

**Import Blueprints**
To import the blueprint into your Azure environment, you must use the PowerShell script ***Manage-AzureRMBlueprint.ps1***, which is located at the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Manage-AzureRMBlueprint).

### Azure Policy
The Azure Diagnostics Settings policies and initiative can be deployed via the ARM template located at Tao's GitHub repo: [https://github.com/tyconsulting/azurepolicy/tree/master/arm-templates/diagnostic-settings](https://github.com/tyconsulting/azurepolicy/tree/master/arm-templates/diagnostic-settings)

The **Restrict Public Storage Accounts Initiative** contains two (2) policies. Both of them can be found at Tao's GitHub repo:
* Restrict Public Storage Accounts: [https://github.com/tyconsulting/azurepolicy/tree/master/policy-definitions/restrict-public-storageAccount](../master/policy-definitions/restrict-public-storageAccount)
